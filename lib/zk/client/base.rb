  module Client

    # This class forms the base API for interacting with ZooKeeper. Most people will
    # want to create instances of the class ZK::Client::Threaded, and the most
    # convenient way of doing that is through the top-level method `ZK.new`
    #
    # @note There is a lot of functionality mixed into the subclasses of this
    #   class! You should take a look at {Unixisms}, {Conveniences}, and
    #   {StateMixin} for a lot of the higher-level functionality!
    #
    # @example Create a new default connection
    #
    #   # if no host:port is given, we connect to localhost:2181 by default
    #   # (convenient for use in tests and in irb/pry)
    #
    #   zk = ZK.new
    #
    # @example Create a new connection, specifying host
    #
    #   zk = ZK.new('localhost:2181')
    #
    # @example For quick tasks, you can use the visitor pattern, (like the File class)
    #
    #   ZK.open('localhost:2181') do |zk|
    #     # do stuff with connection
    #   end
