    # This is the default client that ZK will use. In the zk-eventmachine gem,
    # there is an Evented client.
    #
    # If you want to register `on_*` callbacks (see ZK::Client::StateMixin)
    # then you should pass a block, which will be called before the
    # connection is set up (this way you can get the `on_connected` event). See
    # the 'Register on_connected callback' example.
    #
    # A note on event delivery. There has been some confusion, caused by
    # incorrect documentation (which I'm very sorry about), about how many
    # threads are delivering events. The documentation for 0.9.0 was incorrect
    # in stating the number of threads used to deliver events. There was one,
    # unconfigurable, event dispatch thread. In 1.0 the number of event
    # delivery threads is configurable, but still defaults to 1. 
    #
    # The configurability is intended to allow users to easily dispatch events to
    # event handlers that will perform (application specific) work. Be aware,
    # the default will give you the guarantee that only one event will be delivered
    # at a time. The advantage to this is that you can be sure that no event will 
    # be delivered "behind your back" while you're in an event handler. If you're
    # comfortable with dealing with threads and concurrency, then feel free to 
    # set the `:threadpool_size` option to the constructor to a value you feel is
    # correct for your app. 
    # 
    # If you use the threadpool/event callbacks to perform work, you may be
    # interested in registering an `on_exception` callback that will receive
    # all exceptions that occur on the threadpool that are not handled (i.e.
    # that bubble up to top of a block).
    #
    # It is recommended that you not run any possibly long-running work on the
    # event threadpool, as `close!` will attempt to shutdown the threadpool, and
    # **WILL NOT WAIT FOREVER**. (TODO: more on this)
    #
    # @example Register on_connected callback.
    #   
    #   # the nice thing about this pattern is that in the case of a call to #reopen
    #   # all your watches will be re-established

      #   set to 10s by default in the C implemenation, and as of version 0.8.0

      #   connection.
      #
      # @option opts [Fixnum] :threadpool_size (1) the size of the threadpool that
      #   should be used to deliver events. As of 1.0, this is the number of
      #   event delivery threads and controls the amount of concurrency in your
      #   app if you're doing work in the event callbacks.
