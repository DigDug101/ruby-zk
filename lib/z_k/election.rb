module ZK
  # ==== Overview
  #
  # This module implements the "leader election" protocols described
  # {here}[http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/docs/current/recipes.html#sc_leaderElection].
  #
  # There are Candidates and Observers. Candidates take part in elections and
  # all have equal ability and chance to become the leader. When a leader is
  # decided, they hold onto the leadership role until they die. When the leader
  # dies, an election is held and the winner has its +on_winning_election+
  # callbacks fired, and the losers have their +on_losing_election+ callbacks
  # fired. When all of the +on_winning_election+ callbacks have completed
  # (completing whatever steps are necessary to assume the leadership role),
  # the leader will "acknowledge" that it has taken over by creating an
  # ephemeral node at a known location (with optional data that the Observers
  # can then read and take action upon). Note that when this node is created,
  # it means the *leader* has finished taking over, but it does *not* mean that
  # all the slaves have completed *their* tasks.
  #
  # Observers are interested parties in the election, the "constituents" of the
  # process. They can register callbacks to be fired when a new leader has been
  # elected and when a leader has died. The new leader callbacks will only fire
  # once the leader has acknowledged its role, so they can be sure that the
  # leader is ready to perform its duties.
  #
  # ==== Use Case / Example
  #
  # One problem this pattern can be used to solve is failover between two
  # database nodes. Candidates set up callbacks to both take over as master
  # and to follow the master if they lose the election. On the client side,
  # Obesrvers are set up to follow the "leader ack" node. The leader writes its
  # connection info to the "leader ack" node, and the clients can reconnect to
  # the currently active leader.
  #
  #
  #   def server
  #     candidate = @zk.election_candidate("database_election", "dbhost2.fqdn.tld:4567", :follow => :leader)
  #     candidate.on_winning_election { become_master_node! }
  #     candidate.on_losing_election { become_slave_of_master! }
  #
  #     @zk.on_connected do
  #       candidate.vote!
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Note that as soon as vote! is called, either the on_winning_election or
  # on_losing_election callbacks will be called.
