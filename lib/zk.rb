  # Since 1.0, if you pass a chrooted host string, i.e. `localhost:2181/foo/bar/baz` this
  # method will create two connections. The first will be short lived, and will create the 
  # chroot path, the second will be the chrooted one and returned to the user. This is
  # meant as a convenience to users who want to use chrooted connections.
  #
  # @note As it says in the ZooKeeper [documentation](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.3/zookeeperProgrammers.html#ch_gotchas), 
  #   if you are running a cluster: "The list of ZooKeeper servers used by the
  #   client must match the list of ZooKeeper servers that each ZooKeeper
  #   server has. Things can work, although not optimally, if the client list
  #   is a subset of the real list of ZooKeeper servers, but not if the client
  #   lists ZooKeeper servers not in the ZooKeeper cluster."
