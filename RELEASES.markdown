This file notes feature differences and bugfixes contained between releases. 

### v1.0.0 ###

* Support for 1.8.7 WILL BE *DROPPED* in v1.1. You've been warned.

* Threaded client (the default one) will now automatically reconnect (i.e. `reopen()`) if a `SESSION_EXPIRED` or `AUTH_FAILED` event is received. Thanks to @eric for pointing out the _nose-on-your-face obviousness_ and importance of this. If users want to handle these events themselves, and not automatically reopen, you can pass `:reconnect => false` to the constructor.

* allow for both :sequence and :sequential arguments to create, because I always forget which one is the "right one"

* add zk.register(:all) to recevie node updates for all nodes (i.e. not filtered on path)

* add 'interest' feature to zk.register, now you can indicate what kind of events should be delivered to the given block (previously you had to do that filtering inside the block). The default behavior is still the same, if no 'interest' is given, then all event types for the given path will be delivered to that block. 
  
    zk.register('/path', :created) do |event|
      # event.node_created? will always be true
    end

    # or multiple kinds of events

    zk.register('/path', [:created, :changed]) do |event|
      # (event.node_created? or event.node_changed?) will always be true
    end

* create now allows you to pass a path and options, instead of requiring the blank string

    zk.create('/path', '', :sequential => true)

    # now also

    zk.create('/path', :sequential => true)

* fix for shutdown: close! called from threadpool will do the right thing

* Chroot users rejoice! By default, ZK.new will create a chrooted path for you. 
    
    ZK.new('localhost:2181/path', :chroot => :create) # the default, create the path before returning connection

    ZK.new('localhost:2181/path', :chroot => :check)  # make sure the chroot exists, raise if not

    ZK.new('localhost:2181/path', :chroot => :do_nothing) # old default behavior

    # and, just for kicks
    
    ZK.new('localhost:2181', :chroot => '/path') # equivalent to 'localhost:2181/path', :chroot => :create

* Most of the event functionality used is now in a ZK::Event module. This is still mixed into the underlying slyphon-zookeeper class, but now all of the important and relevant methods are documented, and Event appears as a first-class citizen.

### v0.9.1 ###

The "Don't forget to update the RELEASES file before pushing a new release" release

* Fix a fairly bad bug in event de-duplication (diff: http://is.gd/a1iKNc)
	
	This is fairly edge-case-y but could bite someone. If you'd set a watch
	when doing a get that failed because the node didn't exist, any subsequent
	attempts to set a watch would fail silently, because the client thought that the
	watch had already been set.
	
	We now wrap the operation in the setup_watcher! method, which rolls back the
	record-keeping of what watches have already been set for what nodes if an
	exception is raised.
	
	This change has the side-effect that certain operations (get,stat,exists?,children)
	will block event delivery until completion, because they need to have a consistent
	idea about what events are pending, and which have been delivered. This also means
	that calling these methods represent a synchronization point between user threads
	(these operations can only occur serially, not simultaneously).


### v0.9.0 ###

* Default threadpool size has been changed from 5 to 1. This should only affect people who are using the Election code.
* `ZK::Client::Base#register` delegates to its `event_handler` for convenience (so you can write `zk.register` instead of `zk.event_handler.register`, which always irked me)
* `ZK::Client::Base#event_dispatch_thread?` added to more easily allow users to tell if they're currently in the event thread (and possibly make decisions about the safety of their actions). This is now used by `block_until_node_deleted` in the Unixisms module, and prevents a situation where the user could deadlock event delivery.
* Fixed issue 9, where using a Locker in the main thread would never awaken if the connection was dropped or interrupted. Now a `ZK::Exceptions::InterruptedSession` exception (or mixee) will be thrown to alert the caller that something bad happened.
* `ZK::Find.find` now returns the results in sorted order.
* Added documentation explaining the Pool class, reasons for using it, reasons why you shouldn't (added complexities around watchers and events).
* Began work on an experimental Multiplexed client, that would allow multithreaded clients to more effectively share a single connection by making all requests asynchronous behind the scenes, and using a queue to provide a synchronous (blocking) API.
